# Dendrotector

Dendrotector is an instance segmentation pipeline tailored for spotting trees and shrubs on photographs. It combines [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) for grounding-free detection with [Segment Anything](https://segment-anything.com/) to recover high-quality masks for each detected instance.

## Features

- Text-prompted detection for **trees, shrubs, and bushes** using Grounding DINO.
- High resolution per-instance masks generated by SAM.
- Export of bounding boxes, masks (with transparency), and a JSON summary for downstream processing.
- Overlay rendering with bounding boxes and colored masks for quick visual inspection.

## Installation

Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the Python dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Both Grounding DINO and SAM weights are downloaded automatically from the Hugging Face Hub on first use. Make sure you have enough disk space (~2.5 GB) and that you are logged in with `huggingface-cli login` if the models require authentication.

## Usage

```bash
python -m dendrotector path/to/image.jpg --output-dir results/
```

The command creates the following artifacts inside the chosen output directory:

- `*_detections.json`: List of detections with their label, confidence score, bounding box, and mask path.
- `*_instance_XX.png`: RGBA masks for each detected tree or shrub.
- `*_overlay.png`: Visualization of all detections drawn on top of the input image.

You can tweak the detection thresholds if you want to be more or less conservative:

```bash
python -m dendrotector path/to/image.jpg --box-threshold 0.25 --text-threshold 0.2
```

To run the detector on a specific device (e.g. CUDA) explicitly, pass `--device cuda`. On machines equipped with NVIDIA GPUs such as the H100, CUDA will be selected automatically when available.

## Programmatic API

```python
from dendrotector import DendroDetector

detector = DendroDetector()
results = detector.detect("forest.jpg", "outputs/forest")

for result in results:
    print(result.label, result.score, result.bbox, result.mask_path)
```

Each `DetectionResult` contains the predicted label (typically `"tree"` or `"bush"`), a confidence score, the pixel-space bounding box `[x0, y0, x1, y1]`, and a path to the saved mask PNG with transparency.

## Requirements

See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for the exact dependency list. GPU acceleration is highly recommended for fast inference, especially when processing large images.
